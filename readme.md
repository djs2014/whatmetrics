## Optional Hiit field

This option needs a powermeter. If enabled, when for 5 seconds (configuration) the power is above a threshold (x% of FTP) the HIIT is started and a timer is shown. If power drops below (x% of FTP) for longer than 10 seconds (configuration) the HIIT session is stopped. If the duration was longer than 30 seconds a 'vo2Max'-score is shown. VO2Max formula used vo2max = ((6min pow er * 10.8) / weight) + 7. (https://www.michael-konczer.com/en/training/calculators/calculate-vo2max) If the duration is 6 minutes, then the score is close to a 'real' vo2max.

All HIIT options can be configured in the settings.
